/**
 * <p>Deletes an analysis from Amazon QuickSight. You can optionally include a recovery window during
 *             which you can restore the analysis. If you don't specify a recovery window value, the
 *             operation defaults to 30 days. QuickSight attaches a <code>DeletionTime</code> stamp to
 *             the response that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery
 *             window, QuickSight deletes the analysis permanently.</p>
 *         <p>At any time before recovery window ends, you can use the <code>RestoreAnalysis</code>
 *             API operation to remove the <code>DeletionTime</code> stamp and cancel the deletion of
 *             the analysis. The analysis remains visible in the API until it's deleted, so you can
 *             describe it but you can't make a template from it.</p>
 *         <p>An analysis that's scheduled for deletion isn't accessible in the QuickSight console.
 *             To access it in the console, restore it. Deleting an analysis doesn't delete the
 *             dashboards that you publish from it.</p>
